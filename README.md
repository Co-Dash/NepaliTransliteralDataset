This repository aims to maintain mapping of unicode nepali words with its transliteral version. An example of transliteration would be `"à¤¨à¥‡à¤ªà¤¾à¤²" => "nepal"`. A good transliteral dataset can be super handy creating an automated machine learning model to acheive such transliteration. So as we are taking an initiative to maintain a good data source for transliteration project.
